    "<p><strong>Business Context.</strong> Air pollution is a very serious issue that the global population is currently dealing with. The abundance of air pollutants is not only contributing to global warming, but it is also causing problematic health issues to the population. There have been numerous efforts to protect and improve air quality across most nations. However, it seems that we are making very little progress. One of the main causes of this is the fact that the majority of air pollutants are derived from the burning of fossil fuels such as <em>coal</em>. Big industries and several other economical and political factors have slowed the progress towards the use of renewable energy by promoting the use of fossil fuels. Nevertheless, if we educate the general population and create awareness of this issue, we will be able to overcome this problem in the future.      </p>\n",
    "<p>For this case, you have been hired as a data science consultant for an important environmental organization. In order to promote awareness of environmental and greenhouse gas issues, your client is interested in a study of <strong>plausible impacts of air contamination on the health of the global population</strong>. They have gathered some <em>raw</em> data provided by the <a href=\"https://www.who.int/\">World Health Organization</a>, <a href=\"http://www.healthdata.org/\">The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.worldbank.org/\">World Bank Group</a>. Your task is to conduct data analysis, search for potential information, and create visualizations that the client can use for their campaigns and grant applications. </p>\n",
    "<p><strong>Analytical Context.</strong> You are given a folder, named <code>files</code> with <em>raw</em> data.

Your objective will be to:</p>\n",

    "<li>Extract and clean the relevant data. You will have to manipulate several datasets to obtain useful information for the case. </li>\n",
    "<li>Conduct Exploratory Data Analysis. You will have to create meaningful plots, formulate meaningful hypotheses and study the relationship between various indicators related to air pollution.</li>\n",
    "</ol>\n",
    "<p>Additionally, the client has some broad questions they would like to answer:<br />\n",
    "1. Are we making any progress in reducing the amount of emitted pollutants across the globe?<br />\n",
    "2. Which are the critical regions where we should start environmental campaigns?<br />\n",
